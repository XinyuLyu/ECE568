Programming language: Java
IDE: Eclipse 
Framework: JAX-RS(Java API for RESTful Web Services) with Jersey
The folder contains both the source code of the web service interface and the whole web project of the web interface.
"StockResource.java" contains all the Get functions along with the URL of Restful JAX-RS. The functions respond to different client requests by calling the specific URL/path. Then it gives the response to the client with the specific message the client requested before in JSON format files. We implement the query functions to fully satisfy the Query functions on the final project requirement, such as show the list of all companies in the database along with their latest price.Also, in order to draw the stock history/real price diagrams, we implement the functions to return the JSON files containing the history/real-time stock information to the clients. 
"StockService.java" contains the basic search functions to connect to the Mysql Database and fetch the result from the database to the Get functions in "StockResource.java". Actually, we implement the MySQL statements we need, then build the JSON format and return the messages in such format to the web front from the back. And the basic functions include all the query functions in final project requirement. Also, in order to draw the stock history/real price diagrams, we implement the functions to return the JSON files containing the history/real-time stock information to the clients.
"pom.xml" contains all the maven dependencies like MySQL-connector-java,org.json to support the project.
